Julienne is an app for sharing recipes with family and friends. It's a SwiftUI port of my open source [react based web application](https://github.com/bmcmahen/julienne), built using Firebase. It will eventually include examples of authorization, rich text editing, displaying firebase images, subscribing to lists, and algolia search integration.

Note that all of the information pertaining to security rules are contained in the original [web app repo](https://github.com/bmcmahen/julienne).

This is a WIP, so please check back soon for more updates.
